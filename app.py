Using a spatula, gently stir and fold the eggs from the edges toward the center\n6. Continue stirring gently every 20-30 seconds until eggs are creamy and just set\n7. Remove from heat while slightly underdone (they'll continue cooking)\n8. Serve immediately\n\nTip: Low heat is key for creamy scrambled eggs!"

Add 4 minced garlic cloves and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant (don't brown)\n5. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water before draining\n6. Drain pasta and add to the garlic oil pan\n7. Toss with pasta water as needed to create a silky sauce\n8. Remove from heat, add 1/2 cup grated parmesan\n9. Toss until cheese melts and coats pasta\n\nTip: Save pasta water - the starch helps bind the sauce!"

Add 1 tbsp more oil, then add diced vegetables (onions first, then harder veggies)\n6. Stir-fry vegetables for 2-3 minutes until tender-crisp\n7. Add rice, breaking up any clumps with a spatula\n8. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until rice is heated through\n9. Return eggs to pan, add 2-3 tbsp soy sauce\n10.
